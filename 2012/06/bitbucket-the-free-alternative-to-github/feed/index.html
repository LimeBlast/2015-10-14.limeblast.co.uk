		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the tip. Most businesses, startups etc would shrug at the $7 a month plan... I know I did until today. The truth is that $7 adds up. I&#039;m a penny pincher. When you look at the value your getting for the money it&#039;s just not there. I&#039;ll continue to use Github for other clients (willing to pay) and for open-source projects, but my private stuff is gone. Hopefully Github learns a lesson from the Bitbucket story.

Took me less than 5 minutes to transfer 6 private repositories from Github to Bitbucket. Bitbucket has an amazing import tool.]]></description>
