		<description><![CDATA[Skip the Mac and use Linux. Everything on Linux is predicatable, concise and logical
- which it should be as it was made by developers for themselves!

Where is the hosts file on Windows? &gt; ```C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts```
Linux? &gt; ```/etc/hosts```

There is no need to play about with package managers as a distro will have one 
supplied with thousands of thoroughly tested packages at your disposal.

```sudo apt-get install git nodejs composer apache2 php5 mysql-server```. A full
AMP stack running in 1 minute.

Perl, Python, Bash and Ruby out of the box.

Where are you deploying to? Linux! Why do all these tools and utilities work 
so well on UNIX like systems? They need to be used on Linux servers to be of any 
use to anyone (I didn&#039;t even know there was such as thing as a Mac server until
I just Googled it). Git is too easy to install (made by the chap that created... 
Linux).

Workspaces. Tabs. Terminal. Text files. A developers dream. Once you get familiar
with Linux *everything* is easier and quicker to do. As far as I&#039;m concerned I 
would rather use a terminal to change a configuration in a text file then wait 
for some bloated software to load and spend ages clicking menus and tabs looking
 for a specific setting.

Free, open source and lets you do what the hell you want with it. Install linux
on your microwave, TV, Pi or a super computer. Macs SHOULD work well as they are
developed for very specific set of architectures and hardware. Linux runs on 
anything - quite a feat really. That level of freedom is a requirement for any 
serious developer looking for a platform.

I would only ever use a Mac for Photoshop (which I&#039;ve never used anyway) or 
Windows for .NET (which I&#039;ve never used either).

Did I mention Linux?

If you rely on a specific application to get a job done in web development you
are doing it wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Mac man, after years of using PCs and the truth I have found is this - if you give yourself enough time to get used to the flow, you may find it&#039;s a better flow.  You get accustomed to the little niceties of the Mac - how you can have a program running but not have a window for it open and cluttering up your desktop, how you can color-code folders, I like how it found my wireless printer when I opened the lid of the laptop, and my PC still cannot find it....

But if you don&#039;t groove with that flow, and you&#039;re more into the PC, then that&#039;s better for you.  If you&#039;ve given yourself the time to know you really get it, but don&#039;t prefer it.

As a veteran designer and growing developer, I notice a lot of good software &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; available on the Mac, so this would be a good time to get a Mac.  But the sweet part is that if you really don&#039;t like OSX, you can always put Windows on it and make what some people call an &quot;UltraBook&quot; - a laptop running Windows, but with the hardware, retina screen and quality of a Mac.  I use BootCamp so I can use both operating systems since you can&#039;t on a PC.

Enjoy, and great article!]]></description>
