				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I&#8217;ve officially handed in my resignation letter, (after a weekend of trying to keep the news quiet &#8211; it&#8217;s only fair that my boss hears it from me, and not from Twitter), I can now announce that on the 19th July I will be leaving <a href="http://ghostds.com/">Ghost Design</a>, ready to continue my career as a web developer at <a href="http://www.schoolstickers.co.uk/">School Stickers</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a good time at Ghost, with the position offering me the opportunity to learn a range of new tools and techniques (Sass, Git, Lemonstand, et al), but I feel that I&#8217;ve somewhat outgrown it (too much of a focus on frontend technologies), and the desire to move onto bigger and better things lead me to School Stickers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that once I start there I will be posting more about the company and my role, etc.. but for now, lets just say they have a really cool system for promoting good behaviour in schools, which you can find out more about at <a href="http://www.carrotrewards.co.uk/">Carrot Rewards</a> and <a href="http://www.classroomcarrots.com/">Classroom Carrots</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that I&#8217;m leaving, <span class="removed_link" title="http://ghostds.com/2013/we-are-looking-for-a-php-web-developer/">Ghost Design has a position open for a new web developer</span>, so get your CV and portfolio ready, and you could be taking over my job.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the vast majority of the content on this blog is web-related, from time to time I have something which I want to share that isn&#8217;t related to the web, and this just happens to be one of them posts. This is the journal of an adventure that my friend Mari and I went on All Around the Wrekin:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-09.32.53.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1079" alt="Our Map for the trip" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-09.32.53-960x1280.jpg" width="960" height="1280" /></a></p>
<p>First off, <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/200438488/3176908">here is the route we took</a> (recorded via the Endomondo app on my phone). It says just over 12 miles on the stats for the walk, but according to the guide we were using, it should have been 8.5 miles &#8211; so I&#8217;m not sure which one is correct, all I do know is that, towards the end, it became a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>For the most part, it was what you would have expected, lots and follow-this-path-through-the-woods&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-10.33.45.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1082" alt="Where does a bear shit?" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-10.33.45-960x720.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;but after about an hour we came across our first cool find, an abandoned house:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-11.01.07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1083" alt="Abandoned building" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-11.01.07-960x720.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>We have no idea when it was built, or why, or equally why it was no longer being used, but it was very cool nonetheless:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8wq1wRgTvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Just around the corner from this was our second cool discovery:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-11.15.22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1084" alt="Wall-o-Slate" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-11.15.22-960x720.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>So needless to say, we both found ourselves a little souvenir:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-09-12.38.38.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1085" alt="Coaster" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-09-12.38.38-960x1280.jpg" width="960" height="1280" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;and I got to laugh at Mari trying to get back down:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_UCgrxWZZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>After a couple more hours we found ourselves, after a near vertical climb, at the top of the Wrekin, which I&#8217;m happy to report had an amazing view:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpZ2SLSyyTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Upon our descent down the other side, I discovered that the Wrekin was an ancient hillfort, which I remembered learning about in school, but had never been to one:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG-20130608-WA0000.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1089" alt="Wrekin Hillfort" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG-20130608-WA0000.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a></p>
<p>The trip had a couple more surprises for us, such as <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.scoresonthedoors.org.uk/business/the-halfway-house-the-wrekin-telford-235505.html">The Halfway House</span>, a house/cafe which was literally half-way up the hill, and provided some much needed sustenance (coffee and ice cream), and couple of private fishing reservoirs:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-13.53.49.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1091" alt="Private fishing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-13.53.49-960x720.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-13.54.54.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1092" alt="Private fishing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-13.54.54-960x720.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;and a disused quarry:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-14.06.35.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1093" alt="Quarry" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-14.06.35-960x720.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-14.07.03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1094" alt="Stone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-08-14.07.03-960x1280.jpg" width="960" height="1280" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;but for me, I think the best bit was finding the abandoned house <img src="/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Although I had a lot of fun on the hike, and would be very keen on doing another one like it again soon, I think that I&#8217;ll have a bit more forward thinking, <a href="https://twitter.com/LimeBlast/status/343429411569299457">and be sure to wear some better shoes!</a></p>
