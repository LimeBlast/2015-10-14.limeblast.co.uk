				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By this time next week, I would have (hopefully) survived <a title="Goodbye Ghost, Hello School Stickers (I start my new job in July)" href="/2013/06/goodbye-ghost-hello-school-stickers-i-start-my-new-job-in-july/">my first day at my new job</a>, and gone back for more. My new job requires that I learn <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii</a>, which I have been doing, and for the most part have found to be a perfectly suitable framework for dependable web apps&#8230;</p>
<p>..but I would be lying if I didn&#8217;t admit to flirting with the sexy new framework going by the name of <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel 4</a>.</p>
<a name="laravel"></a><h2>Laravel?</h2>
<p>I first learnt of Laravel by reading articles published by <span class="removed_link" title="http://jeffrey-way.com/">Jeffrey Way</span> in Web Designer magazine. It is a framework which takes advantage of the latest developments in PHP (such as Composer), and makes building sites more.. well.. fun!</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a post about explaining how great Laravel is however (<a href="https://tutsplus.com/tutorial/why-laravel-is-taking-the-php-community-by-storm/">I&#8217;ll let Jeffrey do that</a>). Rather, this is a post, primarily aimed at myself, to list all the useful composer packages which I&#8217;ve found during my time learning the framework, and as I&#8217;m still learning the framework, as I find new and existing packages, I&#8217;ll try to keep this post updated accordingly.</p>
<a name="packages-i8217ve-used"></a><h2>Packages I&#8217;ve used</h2>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators">JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators</a></h3>
<p>This is the first of three packages created by Jeffrey Way which I&#8217;m going to recommend. It builds upon <span class="removed_link" title="http://four.laravel.com/docs/artisan">Artisan</span> by adding a number code generation tasks to it. One of the things I liked about CakePHP (back in 2006) was it&#8217;s Bake feature &#8211; and this is the closest thing I&#8217;ve found to it in any framework (although, I have seen that Yii also offers something similar).</p>
<h3><span class="removed_link" title="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-Guard">JeffreyWay/Laravel-Guard</span></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://guardgem.org/">Guard</a> since I discovered it&#8217;s ability to automate a large amount of your workflow simply by watching for file changes and acting accordingly, i.e. you can set it to automatically compile Sass files before <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload">livereload</a>&#8216;ing your screen. This package makes the process of configuring Guard for use with Laravel really simple.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-Test-Helpers">JeffreyWay/Laravel-Test-Helpers</a></h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about Test Driven Development, but I&#8217;m currently learning how to do it (<a href="https://leanpub.com/laravel-testing-decoded">thanks, once again, to Jeffrey Way</a>), and I know enough to make me want to use the technique for everything I build. This package helps simplify the process by offering a number of shortcut methods for the tasks you&#8217;re most  likely to do.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper">barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper</a></h3>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve been trying to get into the flow of using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> for coding, I keep reverting back to <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a> for a number of it&#8217;s features, one of which being code autocompletion. The problem I&#8217;ve found, however, <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/facades">Laravel&#8217;s facades</a> paradigm prevents this from working out of the box. This package seeks to rectify this problem by creating  a docblock helper file which the IDE can take cues from.</p>
<a name="packages-i8217ve-not-used8230-yet"></a><h2>Packages I&#8217;ve not used&#8230; yet</h2>
