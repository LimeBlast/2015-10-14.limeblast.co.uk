				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After spending almost all of my spare time during the last four weeks working on designing and building the Lime Blast site, I had gotten to a point on Saturday morning where all I had to do was fix the homepage, and the site was ready to go live.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the fun in that? So rather than do the sensible thing, and just upload the site, <strong>I instead chose to start fresh and build the site all over again from scratch</strong>.</p>
<p>Why?Â Well, there are a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that I had spent a good portion of the last week updating the <span class="removed_link" title="https://github.com/LimeBlast/limeBase">limeBase theme</span> on which the Lime Blast site was based. These updates included the latest versions of HTML5 Boilerplate, improved CSS structuring, improved media query responsiveness, and quite a lot of tweaks to the WordPress specific functionality.</p>
<p>The second is that the majority of time spend building the initial site was experimentation to see what was possible. I&#8217;m still new to WordPress, and while I&#8217;m much better at building for it than I was four months ago, I know I&#8217;ve still got a lot to learn. I&#8217;m also starting to understand HTML5 and CSS3 much better than I did before, but the downside of this was the labrynth of HTML and CSS that I had left behind. Pretty much the same thing happened with the Ghost Design site.</p>
<p>The way I see it, this site is my most important showcase &#8211; if I can&#8217;t show the world how good I am on my own site, then how good am I going to be working on someone else&#8217;s site?</p>
