				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I&#8217;ve officially handed in my resignation letter, (after a weekend of trying to keep the news quiet &#8211; it&#8217;s only fair that my boss hears it from me, and not from Twitter), I can now announce that on the 19th July I will be leaving <a href="http://ghostds.com/">Ghost Design</a>, ready to continue my career as a web developer at <a href="http://www.schoolstickers.co.uk/">School Stickers</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a good time at Ghost, with the position offering me the opportunity to learn a range of new tools and techniques (Sass, Git, Lemonstand, et al), but I feel that I&#8217;ve somewhat outgrown it (too much of a focus on frontend technologies), and the desire to move onto bigger and better things lead me to School Stickers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that once I start there I will be posting more about the company and my role, etc.. but for now, lets just say they have a really cool system for promoting good behaviour in schools, which you can find out more about at <a href="http://www.carrotrewards.co.uk/">Carrot Rewards</a> and <a href="http://www.classroomcarrots.com/">Classroom Carrots</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that I&#8217;m leaving, <span class="removed_link" title="http://ghostds.com/2013/we-are-looking-for-a-php-web-developer/">Ghost Design has a position open for a new web developer</span>, so get your CV and portfolio ready, and you could be taking over my job.</p>
