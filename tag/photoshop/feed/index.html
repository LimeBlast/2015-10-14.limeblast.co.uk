				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a name="introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to make this post for a few months now, but one thing lead to another, and before I knew it an unhealthy amount of procrastination had set in. I really don&#8217;t have any real excuse for this either, as all I really wanted to do was share the following resource with you&#8230;</p>
<a name="ios-app-icon-template"></a><h2>iOS App Icon Template</h2>
<p>The <span class="removed_link" title="http://appicontemplate.com/">iOS App Icon Template</span> is a Photoshop template (and action) which makes it easy to create, and then export, an iOS icon in all the different sizes you might require, for whatever purpose you might require them (in this instance, we&#8217;re looking to provide a custom icon for <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.spxtech.com/add-a-website-to-your-ios-home-screen/">sites that get added to the iOS home screen</span>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll not go into detail on how to use the template itself (its site does a good enough job of that), but I will tell you that once you&#8217;ve created the files, you need to rename the files with the relevant dimensions like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>apple-touch-icon-114&#215;114-precomposed.png</li>
<li>apple-touch-icon-144&#215;144-precomposed.png</li>
<li>apple-touch-icon-57&#215;57-precomposed.png</li>
<li>apple-touch-icon-72&#215;72-precomposed.png</li>
<li>apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png <em>(57&#215;57)</em></li>
<li>apple-touch-icon.png <em>(57&#215;57)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve done this, and compressed them using <a href="http://tinypng.org/">TinyPNG</a>, simply upload to the root of your site, and iOS (upon someone choosing to add your site to their home screen) will do the rest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seeing as Facebook&#8217;s Timeline feature is <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.computeractive.co.uk/ca/computeractive-blog/2156561/facebook-timeline-reach-pages-march">making the move to Pages</span>, I figured that now was a good time to share the <a href="http://ausgetrock.net/en/blog/nico/facebook-timeline-hack-template-update">Facebook Timeline Hack Template</a> that I used to style up <a href="https://www.facebook.com/limeblast">my Timeline Page</a>.</p>
<p>The download includes a Photoshop template file which gives you a mock-up of Timeline header to style up, and an action file which allows you to save the separate header and avatar files ready for uploading to Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Timeline.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-250" title="My Facebook Timeline Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Timeline-520x262.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see above, even someone with zero design and graphical talent, such as myself, is able to put something rather attractive together.</p>
