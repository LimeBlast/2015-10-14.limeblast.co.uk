				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a name="original-article"></a><h2>Original article</h2>
<p>As I&#8217;m in the very early stages of setting up a freelance web development business, I wanted to give a very quick shout out to <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Stuff &amp; Nonsense</a> for their fantastic <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/">Contract Killer</a> &#8211; an open-source contract for web designers and developers.</p>
<p>Not only does provide the beginnings of a very well written (in plain English) contract for you to modify as required, but it also goes into a lot of detail to explain why the different parts of the contract exist. I think my favorite part is its clarification on browser testing, specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I have access to wonderful resources such as the fantastic <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job">Design is a Job</a> book by <span class="removed_link" title="http://muledesign.com/about/mike-monteiro/">Mike Monteiro</span> (if you get a chance, watch his <em><a href="http://vimeo.com/22053820">Fuck you. Pay Me.</a></em> lecture), and <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/kits/web-design-business-kit/">The Web Design Business Kit</a> published by <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/">SitePoint</a>, they both fall short in comparison to what Contract Killer provides regarding this very important legal document (seriously, watch <em>Fuck You. Pay Me.</em>)</p>
<a name="update-26th-january-2013"></a><h2>Update (26th January 2013)</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s taken me 28 revisions, and a week of editing, but I&#8217;m happy to share with you the <a href="https://www.docracy.com/5uizac7us3/web-development-project-contract">Lime Blast edition of Contract Killer 3</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not currently 100% happy with it, mostly because I don&#8217;t know anything about British contract law (and as such, I&#8217;m a little bit nervous about actually using it), but I&#8217;m hoping what I&#8217;ve ended up with is going to be suitable for my needs.</p>
