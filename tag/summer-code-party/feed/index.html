				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><ins><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;m probably going to have to cancel this event. While I don&#8217;t want to, the simple fact that I couldn&#8217;t find anyone that was interested, combined with a very attractive alternative offer, means it probably wasn&#8217;t meant to be. I&#8217;m a little disappointed by this, but it isn&#8217;t the end of the world.</ins></p>
<hr />
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m quite keen on hosting a <span class="removed_link" title="https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/about/summer_campaign/">Summer Code Party</span>.</p>
<a name="huh"></a><h2>Huh?</h2>
<p>The basic idea is, starting on the 23rd June, all over the world groups of like-minded individuals get together and do something Web related. The aim would be for these individuals to learn something new about the Web, improve their design and development techniques, and hopefully use these newly learnt skills to contribute towards the evolution of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so totally down with that idea I get excited at the though of it, so much so that I want to host a party of my own in <em>Leamington Spa</em> &#8211; but before I start to make plans&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;I need to know if other people are keen on joining me</strong>.</p>
<a name="what8217s-the-big-idea"></a><h2>What&#8217;s the big idea?</h2>
<p>Mozilla (the guys behind this initiative) have suggested three types of event that could be hosted:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/guides/kitchen-table/">Kitchen Table</span></li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/guides/hack-jam/">Hack Jam</span></li>
<li><span class="removed_link" title="https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/guides/pop-up/">Pop Up</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I&#8217;m most interested in hosting as Hack Jam, as I think this could be a good way of getting some of my web-related ideas started, but I&#8217;m totally open to suggestion, and would be happy to go in whatever direction the majority wanted to go in.</p>
<a name="sounds-good-what-do-i-do"></a><h2>Sounds good, what do I do?</h2>
<p>If this sounds like something you&#8217;d want to get involved in,<strong> let me know.</strong> You can post a comment below, use my <span class="removed_link" title="http://limeblast.co.uk/contact/">contact form</span>, or even contact me on <a href="http://twitter.com/limeblast">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/limeblast">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(PS, even if you&#8217;re not interested, your friends might be, so please retweet on Twitter and/or share on Facebook, and help me make this happen)</p>
