				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog is, for the most part, (despite, in reality, being nothing more than a personal blog, which could easily be likened to that of <a href="http://daisythecurlycat.blogspot.co.uk/">blogs by people who have cats</a>) trying its best to find its footing within the blogosphere, and present itself somewhere that people can quality information useful within the Web industry.</p>
<p>To this end, I would suggest that about 90% of this blog&#8217;s content is dedicated towards the Web. The remaining 10% is split between <a href="http://limeblast.co.uk/category/rants/">personal rants</a> and other such insight into my own life (8%) and personal gaming interests (1%). But what about the last 1%?</p>
<a name="just-plain-awesome"></a><h2>Just Plain AWESOME!!!</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve set-up a new category dedicated to all the things that I find awesome. I don&#8217;t mean just good, or nice, and event excellent - <strong>I&#8217;m talking mind-blowingly awesome stuff.</strong></p>
<p>To this end, please allow me to present the video which prompted be to create this category:</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PlwDbSYicM&amp;w=540]</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not into superheroes, or maybe prefer some of the other more interesting superheroes (I can&#8217;t say I care at all about Superman myself), this is a video well worth watching just because it is so funny. You might also notice that is has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWfFHTRZqdw">more than just a few famous faces</a> playing the various characters in the film.</p>
