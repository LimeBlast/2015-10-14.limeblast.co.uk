				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we are, post number three in the <em>Just Plain Awesome</em> category of Lime Blast, and we have another video (well, I&#8217;m not one to buck a trend).</p>
<p>The video starts with a fairly non-descrip introduction by Hugh Grant, who talks about the titular newspapers&#8217; integrity and journalistic practices, and the fact that if they say they have an important announcement to make, it isn&#8217;t going to be some obnoxious marketing gimmick&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; then it happens! (watch the video, I don&#8217;t want to spoil it)</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pVySc2Qu3WI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but any institution that has a good sense of humour about itself is good in my books.</p>
<p>Will this make me buy the aforementioned newspapers? Probably not. But I might consider subscribing to their RSS feeds.</p>
