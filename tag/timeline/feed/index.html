				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seeing as Facebook&#8217;s Timeline feature is <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.computeractive.co.uk/ca/computeractive-blog/2156561/facebook-timeline-reach-pages-march">making the move to Pages</span>, I figured that now was a good time to share the <a href="http://ausgetrock.net/en/blog/nico/facebook-timeline-hack-template-update">Facebook Timeline Hack Template</a> that I used to style up <a href="https://www.facebook.com/limeblast">my Timeline Page</a>.</p>
<p>The download includes a Photoshop template file which gives you a mock-up of Timeline header to style up, and an action file which allows you to save the separate header and avatar files ready for uploading to Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Timeline.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-250" title="My Facebook Timeline Page" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Timeline-520x262.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see above, even someone with zero design and graphical talent, such as myself, is able to put something rather attractive together.</p>
