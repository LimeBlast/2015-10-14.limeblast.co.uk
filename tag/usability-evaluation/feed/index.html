				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have an idea. But like all potentially good ideas, I need evidence to back it up. Because of this, I&#8217;ve created a quick survey to try and gather said evidence.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a web studio company boss, a project manager for a web design company, senior web designer, or even freelancer; i.e. someone that can answer questions on behalf of your company, on its policies regarding Usability Evaluations, it would be very helpful if you could take a few minutes, and <a href="http://limeblast.polldaddy.com/s/usability-evaluations-within-web-design-industry">click here to complete the survey</a>.</p>
<p>The results of the survey will be published in the form of a report, so if you&#8217;re interested in reading the report, be sure to subscribe to the newsletter on the last page of the survey.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
