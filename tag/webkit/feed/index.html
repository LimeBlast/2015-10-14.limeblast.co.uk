				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although there is a lot of love for CSS preprocessors such as <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, both of which seem to work very well, I wanted to take a moment to talk about a slightly different alternative, the PHP-based <a href="http://the-echoplex.net/csscrush/">CSS Crush</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the other CSS preprocessors, CSS Crush offers a range of features designed to make your life easier. Although these including functions that let you do things like manipulate the opacity of a colour value, or generate a data uri from a relative file path, I&#8217;m going to talk about some of the other features that I have experience with.</p>
<a name="vendor-prefixing"></a><h2>Vendor prefixing</h2>
<p>The first, and possibly most important of these, is vendor prefixing. There has been a lot of talk in recent months about <a href="http://remysharp.com/2012/02/09/vendor-prefixes-about-to-go-south/">non-webkit browsers adopting the -webkit prefix</a>, which has been spurred on by the fact that, to be honest, vendor prefixes are a pain in the arse.</p>
<p>CSS Crush helps solve issues like this by automatically adding all relevant prefixes to the properties that support them, meaning that this:</p>
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate">div { background: #fff linear-gradient( left, red, white ) no-repeat; }</pre>
<p>will automatically be converted into this:</p>
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate">div {
    background: #fff -webkit-linear-gradient( left, red, white ) no-repeat;
    background: #fff -moz-linear-gradient( left, red, white ) no-repeat;
    background: #fff -ms-linear-gradient( left, red, white ) no-repeat;
    background: #fff -o-linear-gradient( left, red, white ) no-repeat;
    background: #fff linear-gradient( left, red, white ) no-repeat;
}</pre>
<p>This is something that (so far as I&#8217;m aware) none of the other CSS preprocessors offer out of the box &#8211; although some creative use of mixins does offer something similar &#8211; but by using CSS Crush as a <a href="https://github.com/peteboere/css-crush">git submodule</a>, you&#8217;ll always have access to the latest prefixes available.</p>
<a name="variables"></a><h2>Variables</h2>
<p>Another helpful feature is that of being able to define and use variables. This allows for uniformity across all your stylesheets, meaning you can define variables such as:</p>
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate">@define
{
	/* fonts */
	title: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Georgia, serif;
	body: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

	/* colours */
	primary-rgb: 89,168,15;
	primary: rgb($(primary-rgb));
	primary-text: #FFFFFF;

	secondary-rgb: 158,213,76;
	secondary: rgb($(secondary-rgb));
	secondary-text: #FFFFFF;

	background-rgb: 240,242,221;
	background: rgb($(background-rgb));
	background-text: #222222;
}</pre>
<p>then if you need to change a value at a later date, rather than having to do a find/replace, and risk missing some, you simply update the value is one place, and CSS Crush does the rest for you.</p>
<a name="direct-import-and-minification"></a><h2>Direct @import and minification</h2>
<p>One of the things I found particularly useful was the ability to use <code>@import</code> to manage different CSS files for responsive sites. A practical example of this would be something like:</p>
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate">@import url( &quot;mobile.css&quot; ); /* Mobile first */
@import url( &quot;tablet.css&quot; ) screen and (min-width: 768px); /* Tablet and higher */
@import url( &quot;desktop.css&quot; ) screen and (min-width: 992px); /* desktop and higher */</pre>
<p>which not only imports the files directly into a single stylesheet, would also put the correct <code>@media</code> tags around the imported code, and then performs minification on it all.</p>
<a name="implementing-css-crush-in-wordpress"></a><h2>Implementing CSS Crush in WordPress</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m actually using CSS Crush in my <span class="removed_link" title="https://github.com/LimeBlast/limeBase">limeBase WordPress starter theme</span>, so that could be a good way for you to get started, but if you wanted to create your own implementation, it couldn&#8217;t be simpler:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download/clone the files into your theme folder in a folder called <code>cssCrush</code></li>
<li>in your functions.php file, add the following line
<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">require_once 'cssCrush/CssCrush.php';</pre>
</li>
<li>in your header.php, replace your existing stylesheet <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>code with
<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">&lt;?php echo CssCrush::tag( TEMPLATEPATH.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'style.css' ); ?&gt;</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon viewing your page, CSS Crush will create two new files: .csscrush and style.crush.css, and output the relevant <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> code linking to the new style.crush.css file.</p>
<p>If, before further page views, the original style.css gets updated, CSS Crush will detect the change, and generate a new crushed file for you, otherwise it will continue to serve the cached file.</p>
<a name="conclusion"></a><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re already happily using LESS or SASS, then I&#8217;m not sure there is much that CSS Crush can offer you. If, however, you&#8217;re more interested in a simple way of automatically adding vendor prefixes and performing minification on your CSS, then you can&#8217;t go far wrong with CSS Crush.</p>
