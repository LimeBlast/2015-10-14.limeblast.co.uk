				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a name="i8217m-having-a-bit-of-a-dilemma"></a><h2>I&#8217;m having a bit of a dilemma.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a web developer, and as a web developer, I&#8217;m part of an industry that is forever evolving. New tools and techniques are being created all the time, and if you don&#8217;t <a href="/2012/07/the-lone-developer-article-published-in-full/">keep up with the latest industry developments</a>, you face being left behind.</p>
<p>In addition to this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V7NoRjI0H0">I&#8217;m a PC</a> &#8211; and very proud of that fact. Microsoft&#8217;s Windows platform might not have been at the top of its game at all times (I&#8217;m looking at you Windows Vista and <a href="/2012/03/windows-8-as-a-desktop-user/">Windows 8</a>), but I think Windows 7 is a fantastic operating system &#8211; I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that Windows 7 isn&#8217;t perfect, but I like it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot like your favourite hoodie: the design might be faded, the stitching around the hem might be starting to come loose, and there might be other hoodies with cool, slick and stylish designs on them, but your like your favorite one because it has molded to your body shape and fits you perfectly &#8211; which is exactly the case with me and Windows 7.</p>
<a name="so"></a><h2>So?</h2>
<p>My dilemma is that, in my effort to try and keep up to date with the latest tools and techniques being developed for the web industry, I&#8217;m going to have to jump ship and start using a Mac.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no fan of the Mac.</p>
<p>Unlike my favourite <em>Windows-7-hoodie</em>, a <em>Mac-hoodie</em> would be too short on the waist, too long in the sleeves, and things would keep falling out of the pockets.</p>
<p>Anything I&#8217;m able to do on a PC I&#8217;m equally able to do on a Mac (and vice versa &#8211; but more on this in a moment), but I prefer doing it on the PC as it fits my way of working better. More and more, however, I&#8217;m seeing people within the web industry ignore the PC and focus on the Mac. Tools such as <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> and <a href="http://hammerformac.com/">Hammer</a> are Mac exclusives, and even tools which support both platforms such as GitHub, tend to focus on the Mac features first.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m able to achieve the same goals as all of these Mac-only tools via the combination of my PC and Debian development server &#8211; but it never <em>just works</em> - there is always something that I need to configure or fix. One could make the argument that I&#8217;m better off doing things the hard way, and that I&#8217;m learning more by manually configuring everything, but I&#8217;m not a software engineer - I&#8217;m a web developer, and as such, so I don&#8217;t care <strong>how</strong> the tools I use work, I just care that they <strong>do</strong> work.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that Macs are fundamentally better than PCs (they&#8217;re not) or that PCs are better than Macs (equally not). It also doesn&#8217;t mean that the tools in question can&#8217;t exist on the PC (they can, if only someone would build them). It simply means that the developers of said tools, for whatever reason, are choosing to build them exclusively for the Mac, and as such, if I want to take advantage of them, I also have to use a Mac.</p>
<a name="once-bitten-twice-shy"></a><h2>Once bitten, twice shy</h2>
<p>Anyone that knows me knows that I embraced Apple once before when purchasing an iPad, <a href="/2012/01/rotten-to-the-core/">which I later regretted</a>. I still have the iPad in question, but it currently exists as nothing more than a music player, pumping funky tunes out of its speaker dock, as all its other functionality has been superseded by my Android phones and tablet.</p>
<p>I also have access to a Mac at work, but don&#8217;t use it for anything more than checking email or reading documentation, as everything else I need to do is completed using an old Windows 7 laptop which I brought into work on my second day of employment. I keep giving Apple the opportunity to impress me, but keep coming away disappointed.</p>
<p><em><strong>So the point (and dilemma I&#8217;m facing) is that, if I should somehow find the £1,500 needed for a semi-decent Macbook, and decide to embrace the Apple once again, am I just going to end up regretting it?</strong></em></p>
<p>As always, I welcome your comments below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much like a lot of other geeks around the world, I spent some time playing with the new Windows 8 Consumer Preview last night. The long and the short of it is this &#8211; as a desktop user, I don&#8217;t like the Metro interface.</p>
<a name="tablets-and-touch-screens"></a><h2>Tablets and touch-screens</h2>
<p>Metro is obviously very much designed for tablet and touch-screen devices. If I had such a device to test it on, I&#8217;ve got a sneaking suspicion that I would probably like it as a touch-screen GUI. But I&#8217;m a desktop user that uses a keyboard and mouse, and Metro just doesn&#8217;t lend itself to my workflow.</p>
<div id="attachment_240" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Metro.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-240" title="Windows 8 Metro Interface" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Metro-300x224.png" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Metro interface, potentially good for touch-screen devices, but not for desktops.</p></div>
<p>The last time I looked at Windows 8 was during the Developer Preview in September last year. At the time I remember having much the same opinion on it as I do now &#8211; the only difference was that back then I was filled with some hope that Microsoft might fix the things I didn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>This is based on the fact that I didn&#8217;t like the preview releases of Windows 7, but Microsoft must have listened to consumer feedback, as pretty much everything I didn&#8217;t like had been fixed by the time it saw a full release &#8211; and as a result, I&#8217;m now quite happy to say Windows 7 is the best operating system I&#8217;ve ever used.</p>
<a name="going-backwards"></a><h2>Going backwards</h2>
<p>I highly doubt the same thing will happen on Windows 8, however, as it seems that Microsoft are going backwards. Case in point, the removal of the start button. I think the start button is one of Microsoft&#8217;s best innovations, and its removal, in favour of a Mac-like active corner that leads to Metro, just feels wrong.</p>
<p>At least the Developer Preview last year let you disable Metro, which gave you the familiar Windows 7 start menu. I would have been happier if this was still the case, as I&#8217;d be able to reap the benefits of using Microsoft&#8217;s latest operating system, but it seems that this feature has also been removed.</p>
<a name="the-long-and-the-short-of-it"></a><h2>The long and the short of it</h2>
<p>As it stands at the moment, I don&#8217;t like Windows 8 as a desktop OS any more than I like Android or iOS as a desktop OS. Desktop and touch-screen users have different work-flows, and while it is noble to try and offer a unified solution (a notion which I fully support), Microsoft have a way to go before they get it right.</p>
