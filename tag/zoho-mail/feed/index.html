				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a name="back-story"></a><h2>Back story</h2>
<p>Back in May, shortly after setting up a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/enterprise/apps/business/">Google Apps</a> account (to help me manage email for the various domains that I own), I had the idea to write an article on the blog explaining why it was awesome, and why anyone running a small business should use it (i.e. it was Gmail for your own domain, you had up to ten mailboxes for free, compatability with other Google services, etc..)</p>
<a name="google-drop-the-bomb"></a><h2>Google drop the bomb</h2>
<p>Fast forward to the second week of December, during which time I was on holiday in Iceland (no I didn&#8217;t see the Aurora Borealis, but I did go spelunking), and the news broke that <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/changes-to-google-apps-for-businesses.html">Google will no longer be offering their free plan to new subscribers</a>.</p>
<p>The news continued to reassure existing customers that it would have no impact on them, and that they&#8217;ll be able to continue using the service for free &#8211; which of course was a big relief for me personally, but a huge disappointment as I knew that I&#8217;d no longer be able to offer it as a solution to my customers.</p>
<a name="so-what-now"></a><h2>So what now?</h2>
<p>So what do you do if you&#8217;re one of the unlucky ones that took too long to get an account set-up? Thankfully the answer to that question can be found in <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5967154/what-should-i-do-now-that-google-apps-accounts-are-no-longer-free">an article on Lifehacker</a>.</p>
<p>For the most part, I&#8217;m only be interested in the email hosting facilities, for which the article offers a couple of solutions, including that of sticking with Google Apps (after all, $50 per user per year isn&#8217;t too expensive, considering everything you get for the money), which I would happily recommend to my customers that can afford it, but for anyone looking for a free lunch, depending upon their needs, I think I&#8217;d recommend <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/">Zoho Mail</a> or <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/setup-outlook-on-custom-domain/24699/">Outlook.com</a>:</p>
<h3>Zoho Mail</h3>
<p>Zoho offer a single domain with up to three 5GB mailboxes, which (importantly) features two-way mobile sync functionality (which I think it fancy talk for <abbr title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr>). You might be slightly put off by the fact you might have never heard of Zoho before, but <a href="http://www.zoho.com/business-apps.html">they offer a wide range of business apps</a>, and reportedly have seven million users.</p>
<h3>Outlook.com</h3>
<p>Outlook.com offer a very generous 500 mailboxes for free (far more than many of my customers are going to need), and I believe that you&#8217;re able to host multiple domains with them, but they don&#8217;t offer IMAP (although it is apparently coming soon). Being a Microsoft product should also put your mind at rest in relation to stability (and the fact that they&#8217;ll hopefully not be going anywhere for a while).</p>
<a name="watch-this-space"></a><h2>Watch this space</h2>
<p>At this time I&#8217;ve not yet used either of these services, so I can&#8217;t yet give any opinions on them, but as I intend to try them out with future customers as soon as possible, I&#8217;ll come back and update this post accordingly once this happens.</p>
